      'Herein,  above is upwards towards the sky’s level. Below is downwards towards the earth’s level. Around is marked off all around like the perimeter of a field. For one extends a kasiṇa upwards only, another downwards, another all round; or for some reason another projects it thus as one who wants to see visible objects with the divine eye projects light.  [177] Hence “above, below, around” is said. The word exclusive, however, shows that anyone such state has nothing to do with any other. Just as there is water and nothing else in all directions for one who is actually in water, so too, the earth kasiṇa is the earth kasiṇa only; it has nothing in common with any other kasiṇa. Similarly in each instance.  Measureless means measureless intentness. He is intent upon the entirety with his mind, taking no measurements in this way: “This is its beginning, this is its middle.”',
