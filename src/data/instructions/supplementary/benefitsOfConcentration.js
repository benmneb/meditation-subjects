      'The question, (viii) what are the benefits of the development of concentration? was also asked, however (III.1). Herein, the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold, as a blissful abiding here and now, and so on. For the development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration, thinking, “We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole day.” Hence the Blessed One said: “But, Cunda, it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones’ discipline; these are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones’ discipline” (M I 40).',

      'When ordinary people and trainers develop it, thinking, “After emerging, we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness,” the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for insight, and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at wide open [conditions] in crowded [circumstances].45 Hence the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, develop concentration; a bhikkhu who is concentrated understands correctly” (S III 13).',

      'But when they have already produced the eight attainments and then, aspiring to the kinds of direct-knowledge described in the way beginning, “Having been one, he becomes many” (XII.2), they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for direct-knowledge and emerging from it, then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of direct-knowledge, since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of direct-knowledge whenever there is an occasion. Hence the Blessed One said: “He attains the ability to be a witness, through realization by direct-knowledge, of any state realizable by direct-knowledge to which his mind inclines, whenever there is an occasion” (M III 96; A I 254).

Hence the Blessed One said: “Where do they reappear after developing the first jhāna limitedly? They reappear in the company of the deities of Brahmā’s Retinue” (Vibh 424), and so on. And even the development of access concentration ensures an improved form of existence in the happy destinies of the sensual sphere.',

Hence it is said: “Understanding as mastery owing to … sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge, and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration, is knowledge of the attainment of cessation” (Paṭis I 97; see Ch. XXIII, 18f.).',
