For when his head hair, nails and body hair are long, or when the body is soaked with sweat, then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified. But when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty, then the external basis is unclean and unpurified. [129] When the internal and external bases are unclean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness- concomitants that arise is unpurified, like the light of a lamp’s flame that arises with an unpurified lamp-bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge, and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it does not come to growth, increase and fulfilment.',

      '2. Maintaining balanced faculties is equalizing the [five] faculties of faith and the rest. For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak, then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting, and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states [concerned, that is, the objects of attention] or by not giving [them] attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali (S III 119).',

For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly. One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it.',

[130] Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation.

      'Strong mindfulness, however, is needed in all instances; for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith, energy and understanding, which favour agitation, and from lapsing into idleness through concentration, which favours idleness. So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all sauces, as a prime minister in all the king’s business. Hence it is said [in the commentaries (D-a 788, M-a I 292, etc)]: “And mindfulness has been called universal by the Blessed One. For what reason?
