      'Here is the construction of the meaning in that case. Unique (eka) it comes up (udeti), thus it is single (ekodi); the meaning is, it comes up as the superlative, the best, because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thought, for the best is called “unique” in the world. Or it is permissible to say that when deprived of applied and sustained thought it is unique, without companion. Or alternatively: it evokes (udāyati) associated states, thus it is an evoker (udi); the meaning is, it arouses. And that is unique (eka) in the sense of best, and it is an evoker (udi), thus it is a unique evoker (ekodi  = single). This is a term for concentration. Then, since the second jhāna gives existingness to (bhāveti), augments, this single [thing], it “gives singleness” (ekodibhāva). But as this single [thing] is a mind’s, not a being’s or a soul’s, so singleness of mind is said.',

      'It might be asked: But does not this faith exist in the first jhāna too, and also this concentration with the name of the “single [thing]?” Then why is only this second jhāna said to have confidence and singleness of mind?—It may be replied as follows: It is because that first jhāna [157] is not fully confident owing to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought, like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets. That is why, although faith does exist in it, it is not called “confidence.” And there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not called “singleness” there. But in this second jhāna faith is strong, having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought; and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion. That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way.',
