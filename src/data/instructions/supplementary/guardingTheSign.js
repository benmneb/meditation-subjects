Herein, an abode is unsuitable if, while he lives in it, the unarisen sign does not arise in him or is lost when it arises, and where unestablished mindfulness fails to become established and the unconcentrated mind fails to become concentrated. That is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed, in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated, as in the Elder Padhāniya-Tissa, resident at Nāgapabbata. So if a monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one, living in each for three days, and stay on where his mind becomes unified. For it was due to suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave (Cūḷa-nāga-leṇa) in Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka) after apprehending their meditation subject there. There is no counting the stream- enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhere; so too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata, and others.',
