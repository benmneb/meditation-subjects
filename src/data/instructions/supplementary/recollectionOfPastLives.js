[Herein,] to the knowledge of recollection of past lives [means] for knowledge concerning recollection of past lives. Past lives is aggregates lived in the past in former births. “Lived” [in that case means] lived out, undergone, arisen and ceased in one’s own [subjective] continuity. Or alternatively, [past lives] is mental objects lived [in the past in one’s former births]; and “lived” in that case means lived by living in one’s [objective] resort, which has been cognized and delimited by one’s own consciousness, or cognized by another’s consciousness, too. In the case of recollection of those [past Enlightened Ones] who have broken the cycle, and so on,7 these last are only accessible to Enlightened Ones. Recollection of past lives: the mindfulness (memory) by means of which he recollects the past lives is the recollection of past lives. Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that mindfulness. [411] To the knowledge of recollection of past lives: for the purpose of the knowledge of the recollection of past lives in this way; for the attaining, for the reaching, of that knowledge, is what is meant.',

As long as any formed thing the size of an atom exists they do not subside; but they suddenly subside and vanish away when all formed things have been overwhelmed by them. All beginning with: “The upper space is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness …” (§42) is as already described, except that here the world begins its reappearance with the Ābhassara Brahmā-world.
