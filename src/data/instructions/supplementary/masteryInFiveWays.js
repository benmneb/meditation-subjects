      'Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways first of all with respect to the first jhāna. Herein, these are the five kinds of mastery: mastery in adverting, mastery in attaining, mastery in resolving (steadying the duration), mastery in emerging, and mastery in reviewing. “He adverts to the first jhāna where, when, and for as long as, he wishes; he has no difficulty in adverting; thus it is mastery in adverting. He attains the first jhāna where … he has no difficulty in attaining; thus it is mastery in attaining” (Paṭis I 100), and all the rest should be quoted in detail (XXIII.27).',

      'The explanation of the meaning here is this. When he emerges from the first jhāna and first of all adverts to the applied thought, then, next to the adverting that arose interrupting the life-continuum, either four or five impulsions impel with that applied thought as their object. Then there are two life-continuum [consciousnesses]. Then there is adverting with the sustained thought as its object and followed by impulsions in the way just stated. When he is able to prolong his conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhāna factors, then his mastery of adverting is successful. But this mastery is found at its acme of perfection in the Blessed One’s Twin Marvel (Paṭis I 125), or for others on the aforesaid occasions. There is no quicker mastery in adverting than that.',

      'The story of the Elder Buddharakkhita may be told in order to illustrate both these last. [155] Eight years after his admission to the Community that elder was sitting in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal powers who had gathered to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā- Rohanagutta at Therambatthala. He saw a royal supaṇṇa (bird) swooping down from the sky intending to seize an attendant royal nāga-serpent as he was getting rice-gruel accepted for the elder. The Elder Buddharakkhita created a rock meanwhile, and seizing the royal nāga by the arm, he pushed him inside it. The royal supaṇṇa gave the rock a blow and made off. The senior elder remarked: “Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there, we should all have been put to shame.”40 ',

The last remark seems to indicate that all the others would have been too slow (see Vism-mhṭ 150).',

      'When he has emerged from the first jhāna, applied and sustained thought appear gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness, while happiness and bliss and unification of mind appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign to mind as “earth, earth” again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the peaceful factors, [knowing] “now the second jhāna will arise,” there arises in him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object, interrupting the life-continuum. After that, either four or five impulsions impel on that same object, the last one of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging to the second jhāna. The rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated (§74).',
