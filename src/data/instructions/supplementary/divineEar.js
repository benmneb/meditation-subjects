			'[407] It is now the turn for the description of the divine ear element. Herein, and also in the case of the remaining three kinds of direct-knowledge, the meaning of the passage beginning, “When his concentrated mind …” (D I 79) should be understood in the way already stated (XII.13f.); and in each case we shall only comment on what is different. [The text is as follows: “He directs, he inclines, his mind to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well as near”(D I 79).]',

			'Herein, with the divine ear element: it is divine here because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as the divine ear element the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections. And this ear element consisting in knowledge, which is produced by the power of this bhikkhu’s energy in development, is similar to that, so it is “divine” because it is similar to the divine. Furthermore, it is “divine” because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has divine abiding as its support. And it is an “ear element” (sota-dhātu) in the sense of hearing (savana) and in the sense of being a soulless [element]. Also it is an “ear element” because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear element’s function. With that divine ear element … he hears …',

			'But how is this [divine ear element] aroused? The bhikkhu [408] should attain jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge and emerge. Then, with the consciousness belonging to the preliminary-work concentration,1 he should advert first to the gross sounds in the distance normally within range of hearing: the sound in the forest of lions, etc., or in the monastery the sound of a gong, the sound of a drum, the sound of a conch, the sound of recitation by novices and young bhikkhus reciting with full vigour, the sound of their ordinary talk such as “What, venerable sir?”, “What, friend?”, etc., the sound of birds, the sound of wind, the sound of footsteps, the fizzing sound of boiling water, the sound of palm leaves drying in the sun, the sound of ants, and so on. Beginning in this way with quite gross sounds, he should successively advert to more and more subtle sounds. He should give attention to the sound sign of the sounds in the eastern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the southern direction, in the upper direction, in the lower direction, in the eastern intermediate direction, in the western intermediate direction, in the northern intermediate direction, and in the southern intermediate direction. He should give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds.2 ',

When that has ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel, the first three, or four, of which are of the sense sphere and are called preliminary- work, access, conformity, and change-of-lineage, while the fourth, or the fifth, is fine-material-sphere absorption consciousness belonging to the fourth jhāna.',
