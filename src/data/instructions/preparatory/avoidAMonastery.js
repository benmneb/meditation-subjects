			'[118] Now, it was said earlier: After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable (III.28). In the first place one who finds it convenient to live with the teacher in the same monastery can live there while he is making certain of the meditation subject. If it is inconvenient there, he can live in another monastery— a suitable one—a quarter or a half or even a whole league distant. In that case, when he finds he is in doubt about, or has forgotten, some passage in the meditation subject, then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards, going for alms on the way and arriving at the teacher’s dwelling place after his meal. He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teacher’s presence. Next day, after paying homage to the teacher, he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue. But one who finds no convenient place within even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite sure it has been properly attended to. Then he can even go far away and, avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration, live in one that is favourable.',

			'1. Firstly, people with varying aims collect in a large monastery. They conflict with each other and so neglect the duties. The Enlightenment-tree terrace, etc., remain unswept, the water for drinking and washing is not set out. So if he thinks, “I shall go to the alms-resort village for alms” and takes his bowl and robe and sets out, perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinking-water pot is empty, and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly. Drinking water must be maintained. By not doing it he would commit a wrongdoing in the breach of a duty. But if he does it, he loses time. He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished. Also, when he goes into retreat, he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus, and by acts of the Community [being carried out]. However, he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances.',

He has to give up his own lodging to those who come late, and he has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rock. And next day it is the same.

One tumbling down, one near a road,
One with a pond, or leaves, or flowers,

In cities, among timber, fields,
Where people quarrel, in a port,
In border lands, on frontiers,
Unsuitableness, and no good friend—
These are the eighteen instances
A wise man needs to recognize
And give them full as wide a berth
As any footpad-hunted road.`,
