      'One that has the five factors beginning with “not too far from and not too near to” the alms resort is called favourable. For this is said by the Blessed One: “And how has a lodging five factors, bhikkhus? Here, bhikkhus, (1) a lodging is not too far, not too near, and has a path for going and coming. (2) It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night. (3) There is little contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning [sun] and creeping things. (4) One who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes, alms food, lodging, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. (5) In that lodging there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned, versed in the scriptures, observers of the Dhamma, observers of the Vinaya, observers of the Codes, and when from time to time one asks them questions, ‘How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?’ then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed, explain the unexplained, and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts. This, bhikkhus, is how a lodging has five factors”(A V 15). These are the details for the clause, “After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable” (III.28).',
